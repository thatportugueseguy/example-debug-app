# Example Debug App

This app was bootstrapped using create react app and is meant to be used as for debugging demonstration purposes.

It has a simple frontend and backend with a fetch call to the hackernews api and data transformation.

This allows to demonstrate debugging in:

- frontend
- backend
- test debbuging
- remote debugging using docker

# TODO

- dockerize it
- add vscode debug configs
- add tests
